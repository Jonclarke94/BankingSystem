//Title
Banking System Application

//C) What app do you plan to work on
The banking system application, has a user based login with record of all transactions and loans made by said user. This information is only viewable by an admin or by the user's specific account. Entire scope of project yet to be determined.

//Why is it important/ interesting?
This project utilizes many real world applications just in our initial brain storming of it. As the class progresses I feel this has an open enough atmosphere to adjunct many additional features to the application.

//What language/tools do we plan to use?
We plan to use C++, and possibly create a GUI for the project. Other tools may be implemented as we progress into the lectures.

//What will be the input/ouput
The input will be user's login and password, and the output will be based on the options they want to view or actions they want to make. Output will be primarily text based information possibly pulled from a database or an online source.
